üåé **English**

**Duty Mechanic** is a plugin for [RebornBuddy][rebornbuddy]. It contains custom logic to handle most dungeons supported by the Duty Support system in FFXIV.

Duty Mechanic is a fork and eventual successor to [RBTrust](https://github.com/athlon18/RBtrust), originally developed by [Athlon](https://github.com/athlon18). Originally it was intended to contain profiles and mechanic support for the Trust system in FFXIV. However, Athlon has not actively contributed to the project in many years and it is now maintained and developed by the [LlamaMagic](https://github.com/LlamaMagic) team.

`Duty Mechanic` will not support OrderBot profiles for the duties, but instead contains custom logic to handle boss encounters inside the duties. Using this plugin, users of RebornBuddy can create their own profiles to handle traversing Duties and `Duty Mechanic` will handle the advanced boss encounters. It can also be used with plugins such as [Panda Farmer](https://llamamagic.net/plugins/pandafarmer/). 

There are still a few profiles left over from the original development located in the `\Profiles` folder, but they are not maintained and there are currently no plans to add to those profiles.

### Automatic Setup (recommended)

The easiest way to install LlamaLibrary is to install the [updateBuddy](https://loader.updatebuddy.net/UpdateBuddy.zip) plugin. It would be installed in the **/plugins** folder of your RebornBuddy folder as such:
```
RebornBuddy
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Plugins
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ updateBuddy
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git2-a2bde63.dll
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LibGit2Sharp.dll
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Loader.cs
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UpdateBuddy.dll
```

It will automatically install the files into the correct folders and keep them up to date.

## Usage

‚ö†Ô∏è Some classes may not survive certain bosses. ‚ö†Ô∏è If you can't clear even after tuning combat routine settings, try running the previous dungeon until you out-level and can skip the "difficult" one. Also, tank privilege is real. Tanks will have the best success.
